 ## Taylor Expansion
 Remember the key principle from the last chapter? It is so important that I will repeat it.
 
 - Important: We can use the derivative to simplify the original function, and the derivative encodes innate properties of the original function.
 
 That is the idea of the **Taylor expansion**. Choose any point `a` and expand the function around the point `a` step by step. That's the Taylor formula
 
 ![The Taylor expansion](taylor.png)
 
 What do I mean by _expand_? We build a polynomial whose derivatives around the point `a` equal the derivatives of the original function. Since the derivatives are the same and the derivatives encode properties of the original function (remember ðŸ‘»?), we should get a good approximation! And the best thing is: ***the approximation is a polynomial!*** For almost all _smooth_ functions, the Taylor expansion is a good approximation.
 
 - Note: There are functions that cannot be approximated by the Taylor expansion though ðŸ˜¿
 - - -
 - Experiment: Tap one of the given functions. Use the stepper to increase the degree of the Taylor expansion. The blue function is the Taylor expansion of the red function.

 The higher the degree the better the Taylor expansion.
 
  - For `cosine` and `sine` you should see that the even/ uneven degress have no effect on the polynomial.
  - For `log(x+1)` you see that the function cannot be approximated beyond `x > 1`, no matter how high the degree of the Taylor expansion is.
 
 - Important: The maximum degree for the Taylor expansion is limited to 20, for `Int` value cannot hold a value as big as `21!`
 - - -
 - Experiment: Click anywhere in the coordinate system to change the expansion point `a`.

    - `eval` receives a value `x` and returns `f(x)`. `x` is in the domain specified by the context, i.e. `-maxX < x < maxX`
    - `derivative` receives two parameters `x` and `order`. It returns `f^n(x)` where `n` is the order of the derivative specified by `order`
    - `isInDomain` receives a value `x` and returns `true` if `f` is defined for `x`. Otherwise `false`.
