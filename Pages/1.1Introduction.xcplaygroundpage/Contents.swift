 # Taylor Expansion Without the Agonizing Pain 👻
 ## WWDC 2019 submission
 ###  Explore the beauty and elegance of the Taylor expansion in an interactive and fun playground 👈🏻
 
 When I first encountered the **Taylor expansion** in my Calculus class, I was scared. The formula looked like a long winded sum of complicated derivatives. But over the years, I saw the elegance and beauty behind the Taylor expansion. What once was a Poltergeist 👻 that haunted me in my exams became an ***irreplaceable tool*** in my daily life as a mathematician and computer scientist.
 
 I developed this playground to show the principle of the Taylor expansion in an interactive environment ✨
