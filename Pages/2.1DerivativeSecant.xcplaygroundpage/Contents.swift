 ## Difference Quotient
 
 Before we explore the Taylor expansion, we need to revisit the **difference quotient**. You have probably seen the quotient in high school but let's revise the key concepts anyway.
 
 The average rate of change of a function is expressed as
 ![The difference quotient](dydx.png)
 
 Given two points `P(x_0, y_0)` and `Q(x_1, y_1)` we draw a secant combining these two points. We examine the slope of this linear affine function which is interpreted as the ***average rate of change***. The slope can be determined with the formula above.
 
 - Experiment:Let's do some practical stuff. You see a coordinate system on the right. Click anywhere in the coordinate system to draw a secant.
- - -
 However, we are more interested in the ***local rate of change*** at any arbitrary point `p`. If we would have a tangent at `p` we could examine the slope of the tangent, and this would be the local slope.
 - - -
 ### How do we obtain the tangent?
 We use secants to **approximate** the tangent! Just reduce the horizontal distance of the two points that connect the secant. The smaller the distance the better the approximation!
 
 - Experiment:Use the ***live view*** to find out the local rate of change of the function `f(x) = x^3 -x^2 +x` for `x = 0`.
 - - -
 - Note:You know your solution is correct if it solves equation `x^3 -3x^2 +3x - 1 = 0` ðŸ¤—.

 You can also examine other functions using this live view. Feel free to skip to the next page to explore more about the **taylor expansion**.
