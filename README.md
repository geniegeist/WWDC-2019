## Story
When I first encountered the Taylor expansion in my calculus class, I was scared. The formula looked like a long winded sum of complicated derivatives. But over the years, I saw the elegance and beauty behind the Taylor expansion. What once was a Poltergeist 👻 that haunted me in my exams became an irreplaceable tool in my daily life as a mathematician and computer scientist.

I developed this playground to show the principle of the Taylor expansion in an interactive environment ✨
